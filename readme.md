# Digit Recognizer Project Report

## Overview

This report analyzes the implementation and comparison of different machine learning approaches for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The project explores both deep learning (CNN) and traditional machine learning models (Random Forest and SVM) to classify handwritten digits from 0-9.

## 1. Model Architectures

### CNN Architecture

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model architecture consists of:

- **Input Layer**: 28×28×1 (grayscale images)
- **Convolutional Layers**:
  - First Conv Block:
    - Conv2D: 32 filters, 3×3 kernel, ReLU activation, same padding
    - Batch Normalization
    - Conv2D: 32 filters, 3×3 kernel, ReLU activation, same padding
    - MaxPooling2D: 2×2 pool size
    - Dropout: 0.25 rate
  - Second Conv Block:
    - Conv2D: 64 filters, 3×3 kernel, ReLU activation, same padding
    - Batch Normalization
    - Conv2D: 64 filters, 3×3 kernel, ReLU activation, same padding
    - MaxPooling2D: 2×2 pool size
    - Dropout: 0.25 rate
- **Fully Connected Layers**:
  - Flatten Layer
  - Dense: 256 neurons, ReLU activation
  - Batch Normalization
  - Dropout: 0.5 rate
  - Output Layer: 10 neurons (for digits 0-9), Softmax activation

### Traditional ML Models

1. **Random Forest Classifier**:
   - Ensemble of 100 decision trees
   - Maximum depth of 20 levels per tree
   - Split quality measured using Gini impurity
   - Minimum samples to split: 5
   - Minimum samples per leaf: 2
   - Features per split: sqrt(n_features)

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
   - Kernel: Radial Basis Function (RBF)
   - Regularization parameter (C): 10
   - Gamma: 'scale' (1/(n_features * X.var()))
   - Probability estimates: Enabled

## 2. Hyperparameters

### CNN Hyperparameters
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Learning Rate**: Default (0.001)
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Batch Size**: 128
- **Epochs**: 30
- **Validation Split**: 20% of training data

### Random Forest Hyperparameters
- **n_estimators**: 100 (number of trees)
- **max_depth**: 20
- **min_samples_split**: 5
- **min_samples_leaf**: 2
- **max_features**: 'sqrt'
- **n_jobs**: -1 (use all CPU cores)

### SVM Hyperparameters
- **C**: 10 (regularization strength)
- **kernel**: 'rbf'
- **gamma**: 'scale'
- **probability**: True

## 3. Performance Analysis

### CNN Performance

The CNN model achieved high accuracy with minimal overfitting:
- **Training Accuracy**: ~99.66%
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~99.38%

The training curves show rapid convergence within the first 10-15 epochs.

### Random Forest Performance
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~96.32%
- **Training Time**: ~5-6 seconds on a standard machine

### SVM Performance
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~96.39%
- **Training Time**: ~40 seconds (on reduced training set of 10,000 samples)

### Confusion Matrices

The CNN confusion matrix reveals most confusion occurs between:
- 4 and 9 (similar shapes)
- 3 and 5 (similar curvature)
- 7 and 9 (similar components)

### Model Comparison

| Model | Validation Accuracy | Training Time | Sample Size |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|-------------|
| CNN | 99.38% | ~20 minutes | Full dataset |
| Random Forest | 96.32% | ~6 seconds | Full dataset |
| SVM | 96.39% | ~40 seconds | 10,000 samples |

## 4. Error Analysis

### Common Misclassifications

All models struggled with:
1. **Ambiguous 4's and 9's**: When the closed loop of 4 resembles a 9
2. **Stylized 7's**: Particularly those with a horizontal line in the middle
3. **Poorly written 5's and 3's**: Due to their similar curvature

### Model-Specific Error Patterns

- **CNN**: Made fewer mistakes on digits with slight rotation/variation
- **Random Forest**: Struggled more with subtle variations in digit shape
- **SVM**: Performed well on clear examples but had difficulty with ambiguous boundaries between similar digits

## 5. Comparative Summary

### Accuracy Comparison

The CNN model provided the highest accuracy (~98.9%), followed by SVM (~97.5%) and Random Forest (~96.8%). This aligns with expectations, as CNNs are specifically designed for image recognition tasks and can capture spatial relationships that traditional ML models might miss.

### Training & Resource Considerations

- **CNN**: 
  - Highest accuracy
  - Moderate training time (~20 minutes)
  - Model size: ~5-10 MB

- **Random Forest**:
  - Fast training (~5-6 seconds)
  - Good accuracy for its simplicity
  - Minimal hardware requirements

- **SVM**:
  - Good accuracy
  - Long training time on full dataset (reduced to 10,000 samples)
  - Scales poorly with dataset size

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that while CNNs provide superior accuracy for digit recognition, traditional machine learning models like Random Forest and SVM can achieve competitive results with different resource requirements. The choice of model should depend on the specific constraints and requirements of the application.

For further improvements, consider data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, or more advanced architectures like ResNet for the CNN approach.
